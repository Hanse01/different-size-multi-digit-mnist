# different-size-multi-digit-mnist

 It samples images from MNIST dataset and put digits together to create images with different-size-multi-digits. These images consist of number of size 20x20 and larger numbers. You can fix the code to scale larger number or increase the number of numbers being synthesized. Later, I will modify the code to be a bit cleaner so that the size and number of numbers can be adjusted arbitrarily.
